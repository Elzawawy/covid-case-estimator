<img align='center' src = "https://region8today.ieeer8.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/05/ieee-hac-covid19.png"/>

We aim to use the optimization tools we learnt in the Optimization Techniques Course at Alexandria University, Faculty of Engineering Spring 2020 offering. Goal of this final project is to understand the causes promoting Covid-19 spread and create an estimator for the Covid-19 number of daily cases and total cases for some countries.
